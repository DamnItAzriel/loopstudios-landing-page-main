## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

For first time set up heroImage and added Overlay text to it. Used pos-rel and text-overlay classes to set position for heroImage and heroText.

Also for first time used responsive web design knowledge learnt from Kevin Powell's course.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

- Add styled bottom radius for links.
- Adding color to mobile menu interactive states. Involves removing background image and adding black background to menu. (Faced problem removing image because of the way i defined images using <picture> tag.)
- Update media queries from >375px, >720px to wider and better range like >375px, >600px, >900px, >1200px, >1800px.
- Adding image gradient for better reading ability of text on the website. (Might require changing HTML for images from <picture> tag was to background url() in css).



### Useful resources

- [Gradient Overlay to background image](https://webdevetc.com/blog/how-to-add-a-gradient-overlay-to-a-background-image-using-just-css-and-html/) - Useful resource making text better for readin gin contrast to background.
- [Gradient Overlay to background image](https://css-tricks.com/design-considerations-text-images/) - Useful resource making text better for readin gin contrast to background.
- [Half Underline](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8572952/border-length-smaller-than-div-width?noredirect=1&lq=1) - making bottom radius center aligned but smaller in length compared to parent.
